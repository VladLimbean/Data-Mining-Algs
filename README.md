# Data-Mining-Individual-Assignment

Implementation of the Apriori pattern mining algorithm, k nearest neighbors classification algorithm and k-means clustering algorithm.

The project was worked on for the duration of two months using an internal messy data set available in the data folder.
The preprocessing code deals with cleaning and normalizing the working data. 
Source code within DataObj encapsulates the cleaned and normalized data. 
The classes in the Algs folder are the implementation of the different algorithms used.
